# #1Variables, Arrays, and Loops
# Create a program that asks the user for their favorite 5 foods. Then display those foods as an array, using the “p” keyword.
# Now, instead of printing out the array, output 5 separate lines of each food, with the prefix, “I love”. For example
# 	I love cobb salad
# 	I love spaghetti
# 	I love pizza
# 	I love Swedish meatballs
# 	I love mac and cheese
# Finally, change your program so that when the list is printed in the terminal, each food is prefaced with a number, beginning with 1 and going up to 5, for example:
# 1. cobb salad
# 2. spaghetti
# 3. pizza
# 4. Swedish meatballs
# 5. mac and cheese
